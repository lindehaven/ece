# Elephant Carpaccio Exercise

How do you eat an elephant? Slice by slice.

This is the result of an exercise to slice an assignment (the elephant) into
three 8 minute long sprints where each sprint delivered functionality and
improved error handling. The ece1.py and ece2.py are the deliverables for the
first two sprints and the ece3.py and ececlass.py are the deliverables for the
third sprint. The third sprint was mainly a refactoring sprint to create a
class and to add test.py for unit tests of the class. No, the development was
not test driven. I tested the deliveries manually in the first two sprints.
But hey, I was learning!
